Hello,

Welcome to one of my very first projects based on HTML and CSS.

The idea and sources are form the Front End Mentor Challenges page (https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges).

I am a self taught. Have some issues with basic stuff so the project is not pro.

This project is a desktop lay-out of some reviews.
